# Ipsum Blog

**Author**: Kris Sakarias
**Author**: Jose Reyes
**Version**: 1.3.0

## Overview
This is a blog that renders articles from various authors about different topics that are organized by category and author. We want to display articles that meet the required filters and expand to read the entire text of the article.

## Getting Started
We must target the articles and show the proper articles that meet the desired filters using jQuery selectors and hide/show methods.

## Architecture
Using jQuery, we targeted elements and performed the desired functions for each user story. Each function is a method of an object that is then called on page load with jQuery.

## Change Log
9:30 - We binded data to elements in the html so that we can access them later with the filters.
10:30 - We populated the filter menus for the ability to sort by author and category.
11:00 - We implemented functions to target items of the list to filter the articles in the desired.
11:30- We hid all child elements of the article except the first one and revealed the rest of the article whent the Read More button is clicked.
11:45 - Rendered articles and about depending on which menu item was clicked.
